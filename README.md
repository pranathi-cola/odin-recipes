# odin-recipes

I'm trying to learn Web Development. I was recommended "The Odin Project". It was of great help and had a lot of resources for me to refer to, making it easier to learn by myself, since this is not covered in my college curriculu.

Andd this is my first project in HTML. I'm not awesome at this but I think I can do well enough.

As the name suggests, this will be short cookbook of sorts except the recipes will be my favorite things.
