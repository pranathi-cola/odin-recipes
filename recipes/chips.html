        <p class="text">I have always been on the recieving end of the cooking. Either my mother cooking my meals or my sister trying out new recipes or my father wanting to prove the skills he learnt from his army days(cooking skills, he didn't teach me how to fight, much less shoot a gun), which he believes are superior to everyone else's(mom's better but he's alr too). And with this project, I think I should take a step back and spend some quality time with my parents(and almost kill them with my cooking skills). Today, we take another step forward for the better of humanity. We let a teenage girl into a kitchen she doesn't step in unless she needs to eat garbage that's probably not good for her. I'll let you enjoy the recipe from ALMALOU from allrecipes.com instead than listening to me rant</p>
