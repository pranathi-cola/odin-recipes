        <p class="text">Lassi has been a main part of my life in summers(Besides frooty). And with the heat growing, I think I'm starting to appreciate it a little more than ever before. I hope you'll like it too. The recipe is from Simmi G from allrecipes.com. Btw I modified it... I hate salt in lassi. So, it will be removed completely to guide young souls in the correct direction. And since I believe in equality, all ages will be guided in this direction. But if you want to add salt, just a pinch is enough. Alright, Let's get into it</p>
